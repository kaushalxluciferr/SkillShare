💡 What is SkillShare?
SkillShare is a peer-to-peer learning platform where users can share the skills they have and find others to learn from. The platform is designed to help people grow by connecting them with others who have the skills they're interested in learning.

Users can:

✅ Register their own skills (what they can teach)

✅ Register what they want to learn

✅ View a list of other users who match their learning interest

✅ Initiate connections and send messages to start learning from each other

🔍 Purpose of SkillShare
SkillShare was built with the idea that everyone has something to teach and something to learn. Instead of relying only on traditional courses, this platform creates a network of learners and mentors who can help each other grow — for free and in a more personalized way.

✨ Key Features:
🧑‍🏫 Skill Registration: Users list the skills they can teach.

📘 Learning Interest: Users also list the skills they want to learn.

🤝 Matching Engine: The platform shows a list of people whose skills match what you want to learn.

💬 Messaging: Once matched, users can send messages to initiate contact and start learning.
